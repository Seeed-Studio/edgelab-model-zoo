## Introduction

Welcome to Seed Studio EdgeLab Model Zoo. We provide a series of pretrained models for different application scenarios for you to use, with [Seed Studio EdgeLab](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/EdgeLab), you can test or inference on these models and easily deploy them to edge computing devices.

EdgeLab Model Zoo focuses on providing models trained on EdgeLab optimized neural networks, which are tailored to real-world application scenarios and enable faster and more accurate inference on embedded devices.


## Application Scenario

Currently, EdgeLab Model Zoo provides pretrained models for the following application scenarios:

- [Classification](classification/README.md)
- [Detection](detection/README.md)
- [Pose](pose/README.md)


## Quickly Start

If you wish to use the model provided by EdgeLab Model Zoo, we recommend that you follow the following steps:

1. Based on actual needs, select corresponding application scenario and choose appropriate neural networks. You can browse the test results that we provide for dicision.
2. Download the selected pretrained model. For public pretrained models, you can directly download them through the model link in the test results table.
3. Please refer to [EdgeLab Documentation - Deployment Example](https://seeed-studio.github.io/EdgeLab/examples/examples) to deploy on edge computing devices. You can also use EdgeLab to run our models on your computer, reproduce our test results or infer directly.
