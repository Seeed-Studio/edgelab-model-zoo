# Pose Overview

The pose model zoo includs several pre-trained models from different optimized neural networks which trained using [EdgeLab](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/EdgeLab).

The hierarchy of detection directory is as follows:

```txt
pose
├── models
│   ├── <network name>
│   │   ├── <datasets name>
│   │   │   ├── <pre-trained model>
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

The `models` folder includes different neural networks, each neural network is denoted as its name, located on `<network name>` folder. Inside the neural network folder, the model may trained on different datasets, so we use the `<datasets name>` to to partition these pre-trained models into different folders.


## Performance of Models

The section summarizes the performance of different models trained from different neural networks.
